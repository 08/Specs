version: 1.0.0
summary: 'YAPTR(TM): Yet another pull-to-refresh.'
description: |2
                        * No need to pull and release. Just pull far enough and a refresh will trigger. You'll see much more of these soon.
                        * Adjust tint color of arrow.
                        * No support for last refresh date.
                        * Built on top of UIControl. When triggered it sends a UIControlEventValueChanged event to targets.
                        * View has a magical height of 44 points.
                        * iOS 5 and up (yeah, that's a feature).
