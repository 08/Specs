description: |2
                      The OBMenuBarWindow class is an NSWindow subclass that adds
                      the ability to attach the window to an icon in the menu bar
                      in OS X. It emulates much of the look and feel of NSPopover
                      but retains the appearance and functionality of a regular
                      window, including the title bar and traffic light controls.
                      The user can drag the window to and from the menu bar icon
                      to attach and detach it from the menu bar.
