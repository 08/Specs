       FXImageView is a class designed to simplify the application of common visual effects such as reflections and drop-shadows to images. FXImageView includes sophisticated queuing and caching logic to maximise performance when rendering these effects in real time.

       As a bonus, FXImageView includes a standalone UIImage category for cropping, scaling and applying effects directly to an image.
