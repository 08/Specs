                      Utilities for common and advanced graphics operations.

                      DSGraphicsKit provides support to quickly perform the following operations:

                      * Images:
                        - Create icons with fills, glows and shadows from the alpha channel of an image.
                        - Resize with corner rounding.
                        - Render a layer to an image.
                      * Views:
                        - Add a 3d rotation along the y axis.
                        - Add a reflection.
                      * Animations:
                        - Add a pop up animation to a layer.
