                     ADClusterMapView is a drop-in subclass of MKMapView that
                     displays and animate clusters of annotations. This is very
                     useful in cases where you have to display many annotations
                     on the map. Concept and implementation were described on
                     Applidium's [website][http://applidium.com/en/news/too_many_pins_on_your_map/].
