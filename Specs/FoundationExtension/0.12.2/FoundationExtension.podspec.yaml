description: |2
                      This library includes small Foundation/Cocoa/UIKit extensions. This library does not includes high-level data structure, algorithm or frameworks, but collection of code snippets.
                      * Many common snippets in a method call.
                      * Looks like native foundation methods - It follows Apple Coding Guideline and Foundation naming convention.
                      See document on [Github] (http://youknowone.github.com/FoundationExtension)

                      Try FoundationExtension for Foundation extensions.
                      For iOS, UIKitExtension is available too.
