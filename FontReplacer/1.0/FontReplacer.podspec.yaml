summary: Easily create nibs with custom fonts.
description: |2
     Since iOS 3.2, you can use custom fonts in your apps but unfortunately, you can't use these custom fonts in Interface Builder. FontReplacer is a solution to this problem.

     If your project contains nibs with a lot of labels, it becomes tedious to setup an outlet for every label and change the font in the code for each outlet. Instead choose a font that you won't be using anywhere in your app, e.g. Arial and use it in Interface Builder. Then create a mapping from Arial to your custom font, e.g. Caviar Dreams and let FontReplacer handle the replacement.
