version: 0.4.1
summary: A drop-in replacement for UINavigationController with stacked views ala Path
  / Facebook.
description: |2
                      MTStackableNavigationController aims to be an API-compatible replacement for
                      UINavigationController, with special sauce for Facebook / Path style stacked
                      navigation. In contrast to most of the other view controller projects based on
                      this paradigm, MTStackableNavigationController is targeted exclusively for use
                      as a direct replacement for UINavigationController; layered navigation and deck
                      style interaction are already done well by other controllers.
