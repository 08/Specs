description: |2
                      PeerTalk is a iOS and OS X Cocoa library for communicating over USB and TCP.

                      Highlights:

                      * Provides you with USB device attach/detach events and attached device's info
                      * Can connect to TCP services on supported attached devices (e.g. an iPhone), bridging the communication over USB transport
                      * Offers a higher-level API (PTChannel and PTProtocol) for convenient implementations.
                      * Tested and designed for libdispatch (aka Grand Central Dispatch).
