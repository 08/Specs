summary: Easily create delegation chains.
description: |
  This NSProxy subclass allows you to chain delegate methods easily. Create an
  instance of PHFDelegateChain, tell it which objects it should forward to and set
  it as the delegate of an object. Whenever a method is called on the chain, it
  will forward it to the registered objects.
